    <p>After 25 years of the software development I bought wooden lathe and started making things by hands. When all my frends and family members got something I've made as a gift I stuck because I had no idea what to do with all the stuff I'm making. Obvious answer would be opening an Etsy shop, but then I've got an idea to marry my proffesion and a hobby by turning all items I'm doing into the NFT's. When applied to physical assets, NFTs are used as a cryptographical way to authenticate the physical assets even if they aren’t physically present during the time of sale or auction. Also having NFT's attached to physical items I'm making have some advantages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Uniqueness and rarity
      </li>
NFTs are by definition unique and sellers can produce a limited number of non-fungible tokens which, in principle, keeps them scarce and raises their value even further.
      <li>Proof of ownership</li>
Blockchain technology allows the ownership of a digital asset to be recorded and be made publicly accessible, making it verifiable at all times. This applies to physical NFTs as well.
      <li>Immutability</li>
The information embedded into blockchain-tokens by developers is nearly impossible to be tampered with or in any form compromised. This helps NFTs be a transparent and trustworthy technology.
  </ul>

    <p>You can buy my NFTs as any other and enjoy seeing them in your wallet, but you always can redeem the NFT and recive physical object attached to it (you'll need to cover postage cost).You'll be able to order different handcrafted items like pens, rings and leatherware. Together with a physical item you'll get nft token to prove authencity and warranty.

    <p>I make pens from different materials - exotic wood, different type of plastic and ebonite. Talking of pen types you can find ballpoint, rollerball and fountain pens as well as several types of pencils.</p>
    <p>I rarely do several pens of the same type, so do not be surprized.</p>
    <h3>Rings</h3>

      <figcaption>Rings can be made from variety of materials</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Usually I make staineless steel rings with wooden layer on top. Sometimes I make pen and matching ring out of the same type of wood.</p>
